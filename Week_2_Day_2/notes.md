Structure: Relational databases organize data into tables and rows, allowing complex queries and transactions. Non-relational databases, on the other hand, don't require a fixed schema and can store data in various formats such as key-value pairs, wide columns, or graph formats.
Scalability: Relational databases can struggle to scale horizontally due to the complexity of their query processing and transaction management. Non-relational databases are often better suited for horizontal scaling because they distribute data across multiple nodes.
Schema: In relational databases, data is organized according to a predefined schema. This means that you know exactly how your data is structured ahead of time. Non-relational databases are schema-less, meaning you can store any type of data without having to define a structure upfront.
Query Language: Relational databases typically use SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying and manipulating data. Non-relational databases may use different query languages or methods depending on the specific type of non-relational database. For example, document-oriented databases like MongoDB use JSON-like documents with their own query language.
Use Case: Relational databases are ideal for applications that require multi-row transactions, complex queries, and large volumes of structured data. Non-relational databases are better suited for applications that need to handle unstructured data, provide real-time functionality, or require scalability beyond a single server.
